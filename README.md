# food-storage-warehouse-robot

This project aims to revolutionize the traditional food storage warehouse by transforming it into a fully automated, intelligent system—eliminating the need for human labor in daily operations. Using robotics, sensors, and smart algorithms, the system manages the storage and retrieval of goods with precision, speed, and safety.

## Project Description

In modern supply chains, the efficiency of warehouse operations is critical. Manual handling of food products can lead to delays, human errors, and contamination risks. This project addresses these challenges by introducing an autonomous robotic system that can manage inventory tasks in real time—without human involvement.

The robot is designed to:
- Navigate warehouse aisles autonomously
- Identify and classify incoming goods
- Store products in optimal locations based on weight, temperature, or category
- Retrieve requested items accurately and deliver them to the dispatch area
- Monitor environmental conditions to ensure food safety

At the core of the system is a mobile robot with a robotic arm capable of lifting and placing items on warehouse shelves. Combined with smart sensors and path planning algorithms, the robot is able to perform tasks with high efficiency and minimal risk.
